# Employees Review System

### Introduction
This Employees Review System is a web application designed to manage employee reviews and feedback. It allows administrators to add, delete, and update employee information, as well as assign employees to review others. Employees can log in to submit feedback on their peers and view their own dashboard.

## Setup
**To run this application, follow these steps:**
- Clone the repository.
- Install dependencies by running 'npm install'.
- Create a .env file in the root directory and define the following variables:

```

PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_URI
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_JWT_SECRET

```
Replace `YOUR_MONGODB_URI` with your MongoDB connection string and `YOUR_JWT_SECRET` with a secret key for JWT token generation.

## Running the Application
Run the application using the following command:
```

npm start

```


The server will start listening on the specified port (default is 3000).
